**A JS library for programmatically confirming whether a given XML document is both well-formed and valid according to the specified DTD.**

Adheres to the `standard` coding style (click below for more information):

## Why?

I was frustrated by the lack of programmatic options for validating XML with JavaScript...in particular, for validating against a public DTD. I realize that there may not be a big need for this across the Node.js community as a whole, but nonetheless it is something I required, so I built this.

## W3C

This library relies on the [online validator provided by W3C](https://validator.w3.org). **Please consider donating to the W3C if you find this library useful, because without their tools, this one wouldn't exist.** Click on the logo below to do this:
